Adds a custom set of &lt;meta&gt; tags to the &lt;head&gt; section of all posts &amp; pages.



== Description ==

Head Meta Data (HMD) improves the definition and semantic quality of your web pages by adding a custom set of `<meta>` tags to the `<head>` section of your web pages.

**Example**

	
	<head>
	
		<meta name="abstract" content="Obsessive Web Development">
		<meta name="author" content="Perishable">
		<meta name="classification" content="Website Design">
		<meta name="copyright" content="Copyright Perishable Press - All rights Reserved.">
		<meta name="designer" content="Monzilla Media">
		<meta name="language" content="EN-US">
		<meta name="publisher" content="Perishable Press">
		<meta name="rating" content="General">
		<meta name="resource-type" content="Document">
		<meta name="revisit-after" content="3">
		<meta name="subject" content="WordPress, Web Design, Code & Tutorials">
		<meta name="template" content="Awesome Theme">
		<meta name="robots" content="index,follow">
		
		<!-- plus you can add your own custom tags! -->
		
	</head>
	

**Features**

* Simple and easy to use
* Clean, standards-based code
* Customize all `<meta>` tags
* Add your own custom `<meta>` tags
* Use shortcodes to include dynamic information
* Includes meta tags on all of your site's web pages
* Check out a Live Preview of your meta tags & custom content
* Automatically adds tags to the `<head>` section of all pages
* Auto-populates tags using your site's information

**Shortcodes**

Shortcodes enable you to include dynamic bits of information in your meta tags. Head Meta Data currently provides the following shortcodes:

* `[hmd_post_date]` -- post date
* `[hmd_post_author]` -- post author name
* `[hmd_post_title]` -- post title
* `[hmd_post_cats]` -- post categories
* `[hmd_year]` -- current year
* `[hmd_tab]` -- adds tab space to markup

So you can display your own set of customized meta tags exactly as desired. See the [Installation section](https://wordpress.org/plugins/head-meta-data/#installation) for more information about the HMD shortcodes!


**GDPR**

This plugin does not collect any user data. So it does _not_ do anything to make your site _less_ compliant with GDPR. I have done my best to ensure that this plugin is 100% GDPR compliant, but I'm not a lawyer so can't guarantee anything. To determine if your site is GDPR compliant, please consult an attorney.

> Works perfectly with or without Gutenberg Block Editor


**More Info**

Head Meta Data is designed to complete a site's head construct by including some of the more obscure meta tags, such as "author", "copyright", "designer", and so forth. As a matter of practicality, the more widely used tags such as "description" and "keywords" have been omitted, as they are already included via wide variety of plugins (such as "All in One SEO") in a more dynamic way. Even so, adding "description", "keyword", or any other tags is easy from the plugin's settings page.



== Installation ==

**Installation**

1. Upload the plugin to your blog and activate
2. Visit the settings to configure your options

[More info on installing WP plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins)


**Shortcodes**

Shortcodes enable you to include dynamic bits of information in your meta tags. Head Meta Data currently provides the following shortcodes:

* `[hmd_post_date]` -- post date
* `[hmd_post_author]` -- post author name
* `[hmd_post_title]` -- post title
* `[hmd_post_cats]` -- post categories
* `[hmd_year]` -- current year
* `[hmd_tab]` -- adds tab space to markup

So you can include any of these shortcodes in the "Custom Content" setting, and the displayed information will reflect the current post being viewed. On non-post views, like the homepage, archives, and search results, the shortcodes display general information about the site:

* `[hmd_post_date]` -- date of latest post
* `[hmd_post_author]` -- site name
* `[hmd_post_title]` -- site description
* `[hmd_post_cats]` -- all site categories

For example, we could add this meta tag via the "Custom Content" setting:

	
	<meta name="date" content="[hmd_post_date]">
	<meta name="abstract" content="[hmd_post_title]">
	<meta name="author" content="[hmd_post_author]">
	<meta name="copyright" content="Copyright [hmd_year] Awesome Website">
