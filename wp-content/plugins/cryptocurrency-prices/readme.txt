== Description ==

Update: Finally bloggers can earn crypto with their blogs! In our recent update you’ll see a Trade button next to a crypto currency. When your readers make a crypto-to-crypto exchange, you’ll make a commission (50% of what we make) in the receiving coin.

Because we’re deep believers in the crypto revolution, we’re working around the clock to bring to life new widgets and creative formats to help bloggers like you make lots of crypto.

Signup to create your affiliate account at Zwaply (https://zwaply.com/register) and place your username in your admin panel. That’s it.

P.S. If you don’t want to earn crypto, just remove the Trade button from the Settings page.
